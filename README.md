# 🔍 LLM Output Evaluation: Complete Guide (3-Part Series)

This repository provides a complete, practical, and interview-ready guide to **evaluating the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Whether you're an AI engineer, ML researcher, or preparing for a system design interview — this guide will help you master both the **theory** and **practice** of LLM evaluation.

## 📚 Guide Structure

### 🧠 Part 1: Theoretical Foundations
- Core quality, safety, and alignment metrics
- Human, automated, and hybrid evaluation strategies
- Reference-based vs reference-free vs preference-based methods
- Classical metrics: BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, BLEURT
- Task-specific evaluation (code, math, creative writing)
- Metric validation, robustness, and correlation with human judgment

### 🛠️ Part 2: Practical Implementation & Interview Prep
- Building custom evaluation pipelines in Python
- Statistical testing, active learning, and real-world constraints
- Interview question patterns (trade-offs, system design, troubleshooting)
- Company-specific scenarios: Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft
- Behavioral + rapid-fire questions to prepare deeply
